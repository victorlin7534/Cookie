# Hypothesis
If we increase the size of the matrix used in our search method, then the run time for matrix search will increase linearly.

# Experiment Methodology
The computer performs 100 trials for every 100 increment of matrix size, starting at size 1000. For each trial, the computer adds the run time to a variable which will be averaged out( sum / 100 ) at the end. This number is the recorded datum.  Every trial searches for the bottom left corner of the matrix.
